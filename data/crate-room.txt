LOOK_DIZZY:
Your head pounds. You can't tell if you're dehydrated or coming down from something.
*
LOOK_FIRST:
You're folded up in an awkward position. Half your body's gone numb, your head feels fuzzy, and everything smells like tar.
*
TRY_EXIT:
You push the hastily nailed-on box lid up and away. It crashes to the floor. 

When you stand, the crate looks even smaller from the outside.
*
LOOK_AROUND:
You feel coarse, splintery wood beneath your fingers. You're in a sealed box of some sort. 
Hope you're not claustrophobic.
*
MOVE_BOUND:
You extend your limbs just a few inches before unforgiving nylon rope cuts into your skin. Your hands are tied behind your back; the furthest you can reach is to the top of your back pocket.
*
CHECK_POCKETBOUND:
You strain to reach your pocket and hear something in your spine crack. For your efforts, you find your phone and a lighter. 

When you run your thumb over the screen, it feels completely shattered. 
The lighter weighs suspiciously little; not a lot of fuel left.
*
LIGHT_LIGHTER:
A click, then flame. The chittering stops. Then-a sound so soft it may never have happened. Wondering. Longing, maybe.
*
BURN_ROPE:
It takes a few tries, but you manage to keep the lighter on under one of the rope segments next to a large knot. The metal starts to heat up.
*
FEEL_ANGEL:
Something small and cold is pressed against your side. It shifts.

You go very still.
*
LISTEN_ANGEL:
You hear something chittering in the dark.
*
WAIT_LONG:
Sharp little teeth work at the rope near your wrists. The creature's breathing comes fast and panicked, like little gusts of summer wind against your neck.
