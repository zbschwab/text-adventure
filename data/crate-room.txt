LOOK_DIZZY:
Your head pounds. You can't tell if you're dehydrated or coming down from something.
*
LOOK_FIRST:
You're folded up in an awkward position. Half your body's gone numb, your head feels fuzzy, and everything smells like tar.
*
TRY_EXIT:
You push the hastily nailed-on box lid up and away. It crashes to the floor. 

You realize you were in a wooden shipping crate; when you stand up, it seems even smaller from the outside.
*
LOOK_AROUND:
You feel coarse, splintery wood beneath your fingers. You're in a sealed box of some sort. 
Hope you're not claustrophobic.
*
LOOK_BOUND:
You extend your limbs just a few inches before unforgiving nylon rope cuts into your skin. Your hands are tied behind your back; the furthest you can reach is to the top of your back pocket.
*
CHECK_POCKETBOUND:
You strain to reach your pocket and hear something in your spine crack. For your efforts, you find your phone and a lighter. 

When you run your thumb over the screen, it feels completely shattered. 
The lighter weighs suspiciously little; not a lot of fuel left.
*
BURN_ROPE:
It takes a few tries, but you manage to keep the lighter on under one of the rope segments next to a large knot. The metal starts to heat up.
