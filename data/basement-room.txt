LEAVE_CRATE:
You climb out of the wooden crate. Your legs don't want to hold you yet.
*
LOOK_ENTRANCE:
Concrete floor, walls, ceiling. A small window near the ceiling leaks dim grey light. Stains on the floor you don't want to think about.
*
LOOK_WINDOW:
You examine the window. The wired glass pane is roughly 2x1 ft., too grimy to see out of, and just above reach.

When you look up, though, you see a something on the ceiling a few paces away.
*
LOOK_HATCH:
A rusted metal panel in the ceiling. Might lead out.
Even if you could reach it, there are no handles or levers on this side.
*
LOOK_ANGEL
The creature unfolds itself from the crate. Joints bend in ways that make you cringe.
It's small, humanoid, trembling on all fours, bone-white except for two small, luminous eyes.
Delicate features and tiny, sharp little teeth. Against the concrete, it almost seems transparent.
*
COMFORT_ANGEL:
You reach out slow. It rotates its head to the side far further than you think it'll go and chitters back at you. 
Though weak and exhausted, the creature seems far more curious than afraid.

You carefully extend a hand in front of its face. For a moment, all you can hear is soft wheezing.
Then, ever so carefully, two long-fingered hands grab your arm with a strength that betrays its size.
Skin cold and damp like something just born.
*
HIT_ANGEL:
It recoils with a sound that shouldn't come from anything with a throat. Scrambles backward. Eyes gone wide and wild.
*
LOOK_ANGELSCARED:
It watches you from the corner. Every muscle tensed to run. Won't come near you now. Might never again.
*
TRANSFORMATION_ONE:
Suddenly, it doubles over. Something moves under its skin.
*
CALL_ANGEL:
It can't hear you. The pile of limbs occasionally emits a whimper.
*
LOOK_CRATE:
A wooden shipping crate, with the top lying a few feet away.
*
TRANSFORMATION_TWO:
Something moves under its skin. As the creature begins to thrash, the bottom points of its shoulderblades start to grow, pressing against the skin. Trying to get out.
*
