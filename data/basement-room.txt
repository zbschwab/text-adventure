LOOK_CRATE:
A wooden shipping crate, with the top lying a few feet away.

LOOK_ENTRANCE:
Concrete floor, walls, ceiling. You think you might be in a basement.

LOOK_EXIT:
A rusted metal panel on the ceiling, just above arms reach.

LOOK_AROUND:
A small rectangular window at the top of a wall fills the room with dim light. The floor is stained, and there's a collection of odd metal circles in the corner.
